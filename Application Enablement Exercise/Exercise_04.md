	![](images/111.png)

1. Write down the Secret Key you received and click **OK**  
	![](images/112.png)

1. If you forgot where you saved the certificate, you can click on the small down arrow beside the downloaded file in the Chrome status bar and select Show in Finder(MAC) or View in Explorer (WIN).  
	![](images/113.png)




### <a name="install-certificate"></a> Install the certificate
At this point we need in some way to install the certificate we have downloaded in your system so that it can be used by a REST client like POSTMAN. We are going to illustrate here two distinct procedures for installing this certificate, one for Windows and another for MAC.

#### --- Windows Users ---

1. Open Chrome browser and go to <chrome://settings>  
	![](images/114.png)

1.	Search for SSL in search text field: you get **Manage HTTPS/SSL certificates and settings**. Click on this link  
	![](images/115.png)

1.	Once in the certificate manager, go to the **Personal** tab and click on **Import...**  
	![](images/116.png)

1.	**Certificate Import Wizard** will be opened: click on **Next**  
	![](images/117.png)

1.	Browse to folder where you have saved the p12 certificate and choose "All Files (*.*)" in the file extension drop down list  
	![](images/118.png)

1.	Select the certificate and click **Open**  
	![](images/119.png)

1.	Enter the **secret key** you obtained while downloading device certificate and noted down in a text editor; then click **Next**  
	![](images/120.png)

1. Click **Next**  
	![](images/121.png)

1.	Finally, click on the **Finish** button  
	![](images/122.png)

1.	You should receive the information that the import was successful.  
	![](images/123.png)


#### --- MAC Users ---

1. Open the **Keychain** utility and select **File -> Import Items...**  
	![](images/124.png)

1. Locate the p12 certificate you downloaded earlier  
	![](images/125.png)

1. Enter your MAC credentials if required  
	![](images/126.png)

1. Enter the **secret key** you obtained while downloading the certificate and noted down in a text editor; then click **OK**  
	![](images/127.png)

1. The certificate is imported, but it's not yet trusted. You can see a message saying that this certificate was signed by an unknown authority. Double click on the certificate  
	![](images/128.png)

1. In the **Trust** section choose **Always Trust** for the parameter "When using this certificate"  
	![](images/129.png)

	![](images/130.png)

1. The certificate is now successfully imported and trusted  
	![](images/131.png)




### <a name="send-data-with-postman"></a> Send some data using Postman and analyze sent data
As final step for this exercise we can send some data to the device using Postman, to see if data is really visible in the SAPUI5 application. Of course this is just a simulation because real data should come to the device from the sensors, but since we don't have physical sensors, we can simply emulate them using REST requests.
However before we can proceed, we need to gather some information from the IoT Services cockpit. What we need is the Device Alternate ID, the Capability Alternate ID and the Sensor Alternate ID of our IoT configuration.

1. Go to the IoT Service cockpit Note down the Host name. 
	![](images/181.png)

1. Select **Devices** on the left-hand menu, on right hand page filter for your device and you can read the **Device Alternate ID** in the header. Note that down.   
	![](images/184.png)
	
1. Select the Device by clicking it and in the Sensors tab, note down the **Sensor Alternate ID** for your Sensor.

1. Now switch to Capabilities, filter for your capability and get on the right side the **Capability Alternate ID**. Note down this ID  
	![](images/186.png)

1. Now, open Postman and **disable** the Postman Interceptor  
	![](images/134.png)

1.  Create a new request specifying the following configuration:

	- Method: **POST**
	- URL: `https://<host_name>/iot/gateway/rest/measures/<device_alternate_ID>`
	- Click on the Header tab and enter Key as **Content-Type** Value as application/json
	- Click on the Body tab and select the **raw** with **JSON** format
	- In the body section enter the following JSON code
	
	```json
	{
	    "capabilityAlternateId":["<capability_alternate_ID>"],
	    "sensorAlternateId":"<sensor_alternate_ID>",
	    "measures":[{"temperature":25,"humidity":71}]
	}
	```
	
	Of course, you need to replace **\<device\_alternate\_ID\>**, **\<capability\_alternate\_ID\>** and **\<sensor\_alternate\_ID\>** with the values gathered earlier. When finished press the **Send** button  
	![](images/185.png)

### <a name="python-script"></a> OPTIONAL - Build a Python script to send some data
This is an OPTIONAL part of the exercise. In case for example you want to send data from your Raspberry PI, you may want to build a Python script which reads the GPIOs values sending them to the IoT service. In this example, we are going to send some random data, but it's easy to understand how the same script can be adapted to work with a real device 


1. Create a new folder on your machine

1. Copy to this folder the **sg\_climate\_dev\_xx-device\_certificate.p12** certificate you have already imported in your system. We need to convert the certificate, splitting it in two parts: a PEM and a KEY files.

1. Open terminal and go to this folder  
	![](images/170.png)

1. Run the command `openssl pkcs12 -in <certificate_name>.p12 -nokeys -out certificate.pem`, where **\<certificate\_name\>** is the name of the certificate you have downloaded for your device, to convert the certificate file from p12 to PEM. You will be requested to enter the secret key received when you generated the certificate  
	![](images/171.png)

1. Run the command `openssl pkcs12 -in <certificate_name>.p12 -nocerts -out privkey.pem`, where **\<certificate\_name\>** is the name of the certificate you have downloaded for your device, to generate the private key with passphrase: first enter the secret key received when you generated the certificate and then an arbitrary PEM password (say: 1234)
	![](images/172.png)

1. Run the command `openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out certificate.key` to remove the passphrase from the key since it's not supported in the Python "requests" library. You will be requested to re-enter the password specified at the previous step (i.e. 1234)  
	![](images/173.png)

1. In your folder you should have now two files: a certificate "*certificate.pem*" and a key "*certificate.key*". The "*privkey.pem*" can be deleted because no longer needed  
	![](images/174.png)

1. Inside this folder create a new file named *send\_data.py* with the following content

	```py
	import sys
	import requests
	import json
	import time
	import math
	import random
	
	# replace these variables
	deviceAlternateId = '<your_device_alternate_ID>'               # the device Alternate ID
	sensorAlternateId = '<your_sensor_alternate_ID>'               # the sensor Alternate ID
	capabilityAlternateId = '<your_capability_alternate_ID>'       # the capability Alternate ID
	tenant = 'https://<your_host_name>/iot/gateway/rest/measures/' # the IoT Service Host Name
	
	postAddress = (tenant + deviceAlternateId)
	print ('Posting to:', postAddress)
	
	# Time intervall for polling the sensor data in seconds
	timeIntervall = 5
	
	# Number of iterations
	iterations = 20
	
	
	for x in range (0, iterations):
	
	    try:
	        print("")
	        print("============================================")
	        print("Reading sensor data ...")
	  
	
	        humidity = random.randint(10,99)
	        temperature = random.randint(0,40)
	        light = random.randint(1,500)
	
	        if math.isnan(humidity) == False and math.isnan(temperature) == False:
	            valueHumidity = humidity
	            valueTemp = temperature
	            valueTempF = temperature * 1.8 + 32
	            print("Temperature value = %d" %valueTemp, "C", "/ %dF" %valueTempF)
	            print("Hummidity value = %d" %valueHumidity, "%")
	
	
	        valueLight = round(light,2)
	        print("Light value = %f" %valueLight, "CD")
	
	            
	        bodyJson =  {
	        			"capabilityAlternateId":capabilityAlternateId,
	        			"sensorAlternateId":sensorAlternateId,
	                    "measures":[{"door_closed":"true","temperature":valueTemp,"humidity":valueHumidity,"light":valueLight}]
	                    }
	
	        data = json.dumps(bodyJson)
	        headers = {'content-type': 'application/json'}
	        r = requests.post(postAddress,data=data, headers = headers,cert=('certificate.pem', 'certificate.key'), timeout=5)
	        responseCode = r.status_code
	        print (str(bodyJson))
	        print ("==> HTTP Response: %d" %responseCode)
	        
	        # wait timeIntervall [s] before reading the sensor values again
	        time.sleep(timeIntervall)
	        
	    except IOError:
	        print ("Error")
	```
	![](images/175.png)

1. In this code, replace the following variables with your values and save the file
	- **\<your\_device\_alternate\_ID\>** with your device Alternate Id
	- **\<your\_sensor\_alternate\_ID\>** with your sensor Alternate Id
	- **\<your\_capability\_alternate\_ID\>** with your capability Alternate Id
	- in the tenant URL, replace **\<host\_name\>** with the one provided by your instructor  
	![](images/176.png)

1. If you want you can also adjust two other parameters like the **timeInterval** which is set to 5 seconds and the numeber of **iterations** which is set to 20. The first one is the interval between each send command and the second is how many send commands you want to issue  

1. From the Terminal window, run the command `python send_data.py`. For each iteration you should receive a **HTTP Response** code of **200**  
	![](images/177.png)

1. If you look now at the analysis page of your application you should see the values you just sent.  
	![](images/178.png)
